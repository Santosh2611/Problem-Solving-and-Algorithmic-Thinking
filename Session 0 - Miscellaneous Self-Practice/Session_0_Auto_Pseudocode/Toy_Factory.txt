Function Main
    Output "Q. Read an array consisting of cost of toys from user. Then, input an integer M depicting the amount of money available to purchase toys. Do Flowgorithm script to find the maximum number of toys one can buy with the amount M. One can buy only 1 quantity of a particular toy.    Input:  N = 10, M = 50               cost = { 2, 12, 5, 111, 200, 1000, 10, 9, 12, 15 }Output: 6    Toys with amount 2, 5, 9, 10, 12, and 12 can be purchased resulting in a total amount of 50. Hence, maximum number of toys is 6."
