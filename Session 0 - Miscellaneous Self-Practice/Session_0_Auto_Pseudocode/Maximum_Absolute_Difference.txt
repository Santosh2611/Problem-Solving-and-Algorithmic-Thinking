Function Main
    Output "Q. Given an array of distinct unsorted integers write a program that finds the pair of elements that have the maximum absolute difference between them. If there are multiple pairs, find them all.    Given {11, 13, 18, 100} the output should be (11,100).  Given {5, 4, 3, 2} the output should be (4,5) (3,4) (2,3)."
